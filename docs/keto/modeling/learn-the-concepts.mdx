- Modelling means translating your permission model to the Ory Permission Language.
- This is an iterative process

Process:

- Start with objects (things that you want to give access to). How can they be accessed? Example: Documents: Users can `view`,
  `edit`, `delete`, `share` them.
- Next, for each verb on each object, write out the rules that give a user access. Example: Users can `view` a document if they
  are an owner of the document; Users can also view the document if they can `view` the folder.
- Next, translate these rules into OPL language, using TypeScript.
