The Ory Account Experience provides a user interface hosted on Ory Network for login, registration, account recovery, account
setting, and account verification flows. You can use the Ory Account experience as an fully featured out-of-the-box UI for your
application. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-node).

## Procedure

1. Open the [Ory Console](https://console.ory.sh).

   :::note

   If you have already created more than one project, use the [**Projects**](https://console.ory.sh/projects) page on the Console
   to choose the project to use with the Account Experience.

   :::

2. From the current project, open the **Access & APIs** tab and launch the Account Experience.
3. The Account Experience opens on the Welcome page, which provides you with a launchpad for running Ory's web-based self-service
   flows in the current project.
4. In the sidebar, click **Sign Up** to initiate the registration flow.
5. Use the login form to log in to the user account you created earlier.

   :::note

   If you did not yet create a user account in this project, click the **Sign up** link at the bottom of the form to initiate the
   registration flow.

6. After signing in, the Account Experience brings you back to the **Welcome** page. In the sidebar, you can see that some of the
   previously greyed out links are now active.
7. Click **Account Settings** to initiate the account settings self-service flow. The account settings page opens in a new tab.
8. From the account settings page, you can view and edit your user profile. For example, you could change the email address or
   password associated with this account.
9. Click **Logout** in the sidebar, to log out from this user account.

## Next steps

The Account Experience provides a rich environment for further exploration of advanced authentication options and self-service
flows. With Account Experience, you don't even need a demo application to explore many of the features of Ory Network.

- Try out [time-based one time passwords (TOTP)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/mfa/totp). After enabling TOTP in the Ory Console,
  you can see the following changes in the Account Experience:
  - On the **Account Settings** page, a QR code is shown under the **Authenticator App** section, which can be used to pair your
    account with a TOTP app on your mobile phone.
  - After pairing with the TOTP app, you are prompted to enter a one-time code each time you log in.
- Enable [recovery codes (lookup secrets)](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/mfa/lookup-secrets). After enabling recovery codes in
  the Ory Console, you can see the following changes in the Account Experience:
  - On the **Account Settings** page, a **2FA Backup Codes** section is shown.
- Try out [passwordless login](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/passwordless/passkeys). After enabling passwordless login in the Ory
  Console, you can see the following changes in the Account Experience:
  - When you sign up for a new account, you are given the option of configuring a passwordless login option.
  - On the login page, there is a new option to **Sign in with security key**, in addition to the regular password-based login
    option.
  - On the **Account Settings** page, there is a new section for managing hardware tokens.
- Try out [social sign-in](https://www.ory.sh/docs/kratos/social-signin/overview). After configuring a social sign-in provider in
  the Ory Console, you can see the following changes in the Account Experience:
  - On the login page, there is a new option to log in using the social sign-in provider.
  - On the **Account Settings** page, there is a new **Social Sign In** section, which can be used to link social sign-in
    providers to your account.

:::info

You need to use the **Link {social-sign-in-provider}** buttons, if you want to link more than one social sign-in provider with
your account. For technical reasons, this feature is necessary to protect against certain kind of attacks.
